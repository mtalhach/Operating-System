Paging is a physical view
Segmentation is a logical view

To combine these two views we do the following

The cpu generates an address with three parts (segment no.)(page no.)(offset)

1. Go to segment table using segment no and find the page table address of that segment
2. Go to the page table and find the page address of the given page no.
3. Go to the page and find the address of location using the offset

Half page fragmentation in each segment
Each segment has a seperate page table

Swapping

Allocate some area in hard drive for processes
This area is swap space
Normal files cannot be stored in this area
The storage is formatted differently from other hard drive storage

If a process is waiting (Whether due to i/o or sleep) an image of the process is swapped in hard drive swap space and some other process can use the memory in the meantime

The pages of processess are swapped from RAM to Hard Drive

Transfer from hard disk to ram and vice versa is a big time overhead

The system maintains a seperate ready queue for swap space programs
