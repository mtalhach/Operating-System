signal --> Generated from software
alarm(time in seconds) --> anormally terminates the program when the alarm sounds

ctrl+c also generates an interrupt (sigint = signal interrupt)

if a handler is used then the termination (from a signal or ctrl+c) does not occur (Similar to a try catch)

the signal handler calls the user defined function in case of a signal catch

A singal is a bit-field --> There is a bit for every signal

struct sigaction act
act.sa_handler = my_sig_handler (User defined function)
A handler is assigned for each signal

ps -aux | grep pts/0 --> to find process number
kill -s [signal number] [process number] --> command to send signals

kill signal cannot be handles or blocked


Shell Scripting
#!/bin/bash --> shell name/path important in first lines
